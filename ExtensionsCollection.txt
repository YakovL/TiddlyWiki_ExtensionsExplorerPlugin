|Description|This is a central collection for ExtensionsExplorerPlugin. It is meant to gather collections of existing extensions, and also to help new authors make their work more explorable.|
|Version    |0.1.1|
Current status is "under construction", meaning that there's a lot of collections and extensions to add. Other things should be considered as well, like quality guidelines, handling forks, etc. Instructions for authors will be published in a separate readme and linked here.
